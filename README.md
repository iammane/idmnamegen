# IDM Name Generator
IDM name generator 

This is my own horrendously coded concoction of an IDM name generator I stumbled across some time ago. It's no longer active but using my own method of slicing together input and strings I used the original concept as inspiration. Will look to see about implementing this on a website somewhere, maybe! Time permitting. edit This is available on https://iammane.link, though not quite the same as the Python version (I ended up porting it to JavaScript, string slicing works a bit different and I can't be bothered to really jazz it up).
